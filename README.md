# FATES-TURN-PROJEKT

This repository contains strategic blueprints and artifacts for building AI-native software development pipelines.

## Blueprint Index

- **AI Native Software Development Environment** — See [AI_Native_SDE_Blueprint.md](AI_Native_SDE_Blueprint.md) for the end-to-end Prompt-Driven Development manifesto, role definitions, technology stack integrations, and a FastAPI sample walkthrough that demonstrate how a human orchestrator directs a swarm of AI agents from inception to deployment.
- **Fate Projekt Orakel Copilot** — See [Fate_Projekt_Orakel_Copilot.md](Fate_Projekt_Orakel_Copilot.md) for the branch-level copilot design covering agent ensemble, orchestration workflows, governance hooks, and the roadmap required to automate development on the `fate-orakel` branch.

### Getting Started

1. Review the AI Native SDE blueprint to understand the overarching Prompt-Driven Development paradigm.
2. Tailor the master prompt templates for your project in `/docs/ai-logs/` (create the directory if it does not exist).
3. Adopt the Fate Orakel copilot guidelines when enabling automation on the `fate-orakel` branch or adapt them as a pattern for additional branch copilots.
